You could teach this class.

Mostly, it's probably fairly self-explanatory. There are slides. There are notes for those slides. There's a welcome email (feel free to edit anything, it's all public domain).

Less obvious:

* There's a companion website, [Cat Meanings](https://github.com/chadoh/catmeanings). Consider it part of the material for the class, like the slides. It's a basic Rails app. You should feel comfortable modifying this site. You will guide students through hacking it.
* There are [scripts to make it easy for your students to hack your Cat Meanings account](https://github.com/chadoh/catmeanings-automation)
* There's a [super-secret companion website that the students shouldn't know about](https://github.com/chadoh/catnip_jar) (*no looking, students!!*). You can visit it at catnip-jar.herokuapp.com. It's protected with HTTP basic auth, and the credentials shouldn't be made public, because we don't want anyone using this when not in class. Contact [@chadoh](https://twitter.com/chadoh) for the creds.
  * It is crucial that you get students to sign up for & play around on Cat Meanings before class!
  * After they add pictures of cats, you need to go comment on them, and you need to add JavaScript code in your comments (jQuery is available) that steals any visitor's cookies and records them to Catnip Jar.
  * Making the readable text of your comments as ridiculous as possible is optional, but highly encouraged! Cat Meanings is a parody of [Song Meanings](http://songmeanings.com/), where the commentary usually consists of "this song is definitely about drugs."

That's it! Probably. Read through the slides & the notes and [make modifications as you see fit](https://github.com/chadoh/badhax) (send them as a pull request, please).
